# Docker Swarm

## Useful commands
- Starting a Swarm
> `(host)$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr <HOST-IP>`

- Joining a Swarm
> `(worker host)$ docker swarm join â€“token <TOKEN> <HOST_IP:PORT>`
> `TOKEN` is reported when initializing a swam on the master

## Notes
When making a network (esle-network in this lab), containers that use it won't be available to the host by default.

Take for example the following network `docker network create --driver overlay esle-network` and the following service `docker service create --name web-service --publish published=8080,target=80 --replicas 2 --network esle-network nginx:latest`

- Accessing the service using the **redirected port on the host** (localhost:[8080,80]) is **not** reachable
- Accessing the service using the **direct IP of one of the containers** (10.0.0.17:[8080,80]) is **not** reachable
- Creating a container and accessing the nginx server (any of the containers in the service) is **not** reachable unless it is on the same network. However, this is not possible with `docker run` unless we made the network attachable (with --attachable)
